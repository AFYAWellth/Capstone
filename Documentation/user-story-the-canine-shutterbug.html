<h2>User Story for The Caine Shutterbug
</h2>
<p>
    Sam would like to visit a dog meme generator site 2-3 times a week. He looks to spend 15-20 minutes each session creating multiple memes to schedule for his social media posts throughout the week. His desire is to maintain brand identity; to show off his work, and to connect with pet lovers through his memes.
