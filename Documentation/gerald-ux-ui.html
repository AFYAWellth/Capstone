<h1>Gerald UX/UI</h1>
<p>
Gerald is looking for a website to showcase his pets using his creative writing and photography skills. He likes write stories using first-person views of his pets.
</p>
<p>Gerald has written a short mystery about his dog 'Ruffles' solving a case of stolen amazon packages; inspired by 'Ruffles' barking at the mailman. He wants to post his story publicly but wants it showcased exclusively to other pet owners.
</p>
<h2> Precondition </h2>
<p>
    Gerald has found the "pet meme creator" website and wants to create profiles for each of his pets and publish his work using the pets profiles as the writers and photographers of his work.
</p>
<h2> Postcondition </h2>
<p>
   Gerald created profiles for both his cats and his new puppy. He successfully posted his original short story under his puppy "Ruffles" profile and has gotten likes and positive feedback from other dog owners.
