<h1>Interaction Flow: Using "what did your pet say?"</h1>
<p>Elizabeth is looking for pet friends and pet care tips, an activity she enjoys sharing with her granddaughter.</p>
<h2>Precondition</h2>
<p>She has opened the app seeking to connect her existing pet profiles with others and is seeking general pet healthcare tips</p>
<h2>Post-condition</h2>
<p>She has pet friend requests accepted received a useful Pro-tip about oral hygiene treats. This has provided an enjoyable and educational afternoon with her granddaughter.</p>

    <li>Upon request from her granddaughter, she opens the app and logs on to her account.</li>
    <li>She then opens the profile for her Grand daughter's Staffordshire bull terrier.</li>
    <li>She looks at the suggested friends interface and sees a dog profile picture </li>
    <li>She clicks the link and shows the potential friend's page to her granddaughter.</li>
    <li>The child approves and Elizabeth sends a friend request.</li>
    <li>She then repeats this process.</li>
    <li>She returns to her user account page and opens the profile for her own Pomeranian.</li>
    <li>While scrolling down her feed, she finds an interesting post about dental care for dogs.</li>
    <li>She clicks the link which opens an online article that she skims and decides to read later.</li>
